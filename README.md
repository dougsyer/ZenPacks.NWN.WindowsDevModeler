ZenPacks.NWN.WindowsDevModeler
==============================

This is a **slightly** improved Windows device modeller, to use, just remove the default Zenoss Windows replace core zenoss wmi plugin with this one

Features
=============================

- Correctly models system make and model using Win32_ComputerSystemClass.
- Adds in the platform (32/64 bit) and service pack level of the OS to the OS Model
    format is like this:
            Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard 64-bit Service Pack 1
- Vmware guests should model as VmwareVirtualPlatorm, HyperV and Citrix/Xen guests should also work
- Added Windows Domain name to SNMP-location field
- Adds Server role to the SNMP Description field (domain controller, workstation, if its a pdc emulator)
- for this rev I didnt bother updating the js for the new fields ie domain and role


Use
=============================
Install the zenpack, the egg should be in the /dist directory

Under appropriate device class/devices replace your default Zenoss WindowsDeviceMap modeller with this one or have it run after the Zenoss modeller

This is a WMI based plugin so you will need windows user/domain/password as with the other wmi modelers

Requirements
=============================
This Zenpack was tested in Zenoss Entperise 4.23, I would imagine it would work fine in core also.  It wont work in 4.1.1 enterprise without modfication to the WMI import statement in the modeler.

Ive tested this on Windows 2008/R2 & 2003, all bets are off for older versions, havent tried 2012 yet

Future
============================
Add other windows roles
Look up other AD roles and add
Add javascript override to rename SNMP fields
